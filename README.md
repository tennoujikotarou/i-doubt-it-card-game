## The Goal   

Be the 1st player to get rid of all your cards!!!

* Additional Condition  
	Player wins if:   
     * The last card in hand matches with the rank of the lead
     * (more condition?)
## Players

* 3-5 players -> 1 deck (52 cards)
* 6-11 players -> 2 decks!
  

##  Gameplay

Shuffle all the cards together.
Deal them out as evenly as possible.

1st player (defined by the rule) plays 1-4 cards from his/her hand:   

* The card(s) is face down  
* He/she announces the rank of the card(s)   
	(Ex: I play 1x Ace || I play 2x Two || etc; or just simply "Ace", "Two", etc)  

 * The card(s)'s rank doesn't have to match with what he/she announce
 * The announced rank must go by order (Ex: Ace, King, Queen... || Ace, Two, Three...)

If any of the others think the announcement ***is*** a lie, then say "Doubt!!!". Σ（￣皿￣）   
The player who played that card(s) must face it up.  
Compare the card(s)'s rank with what he/she announced earlier:  

* If true, the **challenger** gets all the pile of cards on the "table". ((( ﾟ д ﾟ ;)))
* If false, the **challenged player** gets all the pile of cards on the "table". ((( > ω < )))
	
Continue the game with the player on the left of the previous announcer.  
If the rank reaches the end of the order (One or King, defined by the rule), start over the order again.  

A round is defined with each "Doubt" call.


###Extra 

* Player can decide to pass not to play the card.  
	If all players decide not to play any cards:  
 * The game ends (・_・), or  
 * The pile of cards is removed from play.  
		
* More than 1 player doubt the card!!!  
	The closest to the challenged player on the left is qualified to be a challenger.
		
* This game can be played with only 2 players!!!  
Other player can say "Force" instead of "Doubt".  
If being forced, the player who announced must produce from his/her hand a card whose rank matches the rank of the lead.  
 * If such card can be produced, the **challenger** must pick up the pile ((( > ω < )))
 * If not, the **challenged player** must pick up the pile Σ（￣皿￣）  
		The player who has the last card **cannot** be "Forced" but can still be "Doubted"
		
* The deck has Joker(s)!  
	A powerful card that's always the truth, no matter what rank is supposed to be played.
